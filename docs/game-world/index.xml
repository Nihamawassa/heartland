Its geographic and geologic features (landmass, height map, rivers) and other features like vegetation, settlements, roads, and other human constructions are procedurally created.
Map Data and Map View The data structure of the map is separated from the visual representation of the map. The map is a two-dimensional grid and is visually represented by rectangular (four-sided) tiles.

River Generation Rivers flow in straight lines from tile to tile. They do not flow diagonally to another tile. Generation: For every tile find the neighboring tile with the steepest decline between both tiles. This sets the flow direction of the tile. Set a base water amount to every tile using the respective moisture values. Go through all tiles according to their hight value starting at the highest tile.</description></item></channel></rss>
