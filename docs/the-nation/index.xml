Industry Types Trade Port: Trade ports are ports used for international sea-going trade. They are a source of cotton and a sink for clothes, machine parts, and weapons. The state gets tariffs from imports and exports at the port. The prices at the port are set externally. For example the naval power of the state has an influence on prices.</description></item><item><title>Other Buildings</title><link>https://nihamawassa.github.io/heartland/docs/the-nation/other-buildings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nihamawassa.github.io/heartland/docs/the-nation/other-buildings/</guid><description>Barracks: Sink for weapons. Stables, train stations, ports: See Transport Hub for details. &amp;lsquo;Cosmetic&amp;rsquo; buildings: Currently, there is no plan for implementation of farmland and pasture. They are only used to show map data. Farmland: Source of food. Not a building but represented on the map as a source of goods. Farmland does not have to be directly adjacent to a settlement. Pasture: Source of clothes, by farmers handcrafting clothes from the wool of the sheeps grazing on the pasture.</description></item><item><title>Population</title><link>https://nihamawassa.github.io/heartland/docs/the-nation/population/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nihamawassa.github.io/heartland/docs/the-nation/population/</guid><description>Populations are people living at a location and working in a broadly similar profession. For example a farming population is living in a settlement, working the fields surrounding their settlement. Or a population of workers living in a settlement, working in the two factories of their settlement. Populations either produce goods directly (farmers) or their labour is an input factor in mines and factories. All populations always consume food and consumer goods.</description></item><item><title>Settlements</title><link>https://nihamawassa.github.io/heartland/docs/the-nation/settlements/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nihamawassa.github.io/heartland/docs/the-nation/settlements/</guid><description>A settlement is defined by its population. The population is divided in different occupations:
Farmers: this is the default occupation. Aristocrats: consume food and clothes. Workers: work in factories and mines. Soldiers: man divisions located in barracks Details on settlements and populations are described in section 2.4 Population and Communities Depending on the available resources, individuals slowly shift between occupations. If there is not enough food at a settlement and there is farmable land available, the population shifts to farming.</description></item></channel></rss>
