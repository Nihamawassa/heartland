Civilization is a 4X game: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate. There is just one way to play: get as big as fast as possible and military reigns supreme (+90 % of unit types on the map are military units). Industrial Revolution does things differently:\n The game is a real-time simulation of a society during the Industrial Revolution. It is a sandbox of interconnected systems. Trade and development of your society are the core principles of the game. Because the day-to-day life in human history is and was not solely dominated by warfare. In this society the player incorporates an emerging nation state. By the foundation of factories and construction of infrastructure, he influences, encourages, and controls trade. Wealth is generated by industry and trade and feeds back into the exponentially expanding industrialization. Wealth is also used to finance a military, which protects the player’s nation against rivalling nation states. Are you able to develop your nation fast enough and gain enough strength, until the unavoidable (?) Great War lights the world on fire? The fun part of the game is influencing this system to increase the power of your state (player agency and power fantasy) and watching the different parts of the system work together (ant farm experience, the player has just an indirect impact on main parts of the system). Decisions should always be meaningful. A decision should always have drawbacks or costs (except promoting trade, should this always be a win-win situation?). The endgame is the ever rising pressure of rival nation states. In the end they have to be fought to preserve the freedom of your nation (think independence wars of Colonization). Think about a mechanic, which makes the player choose by his own will war and aggression. -\u0026gt; Military-Industrial Complex: escalating political tension leads to more tax money being used for military spending and weapons development instead of other state activities. The player has no direct control of budgeting. But by choosing escalation, he gets more money for his industries.  Who may want to play that game?      If you enjoy creating a small world If you like to immerse yourself into a fantasy world with strong connections to the time of the Industrial Revolution If you enjoy emerging gameplay and narrative  What are you doing in Industrial Revolution?      Build factories and infrastructure for a trade network to earn wealth. Use this wealth to advance technology, accelerate the industrial development and prepare your nation against your rivals. Develop your nation and build a strong defense to win the final clash of the Great War.  Other features of Industrial Revolution      The landscape/map is made out of tiles. The map is predefined and consists of a diverse landscape with streams and river valleys. At first the map represents an island nation (no land interactions with other nations). There are resources to trade and a money resource for price and cost calculations The population is dynamic. People go from places with high unemployment/low wages to places with need for workers/high wages.

Its geographic and geologic features (landmass, height map, rivers) and other features like vegetation, settlements, roads, and other human constructions are procedurally created.\nMap Data and Map View     The data structure of the map is separated from the visual representation of the map. The map is a two-dimensional grid and is visually represented by rectangular (four-sided) tiles. Each grid location (or tile) has additional data fields which determines the tile characteristics:\n Height map: Procedurally generated heightmap with landmasses (e.g. plains, sea, hills, mountains, … ). Height is in meters. Temperature: Average yearly temperature in degree Celsius procedurally generated by latitude and height from sea level. Maybe in future iterations temperature changes dynamically with seasons and weather. Rainfall and Moisture: Average moisture (soil water) procedurally generated by rainfall, sea and river presence. Maybe in future iterations moisture also changes dynamically with seasons and weather. Fertility: soil fertility is determined by average yearly temperature and soil water. Grain and Grazing Yield Rates: potential of tile to grow grains and grass. Depends on moisture, average temperature, and altitude. Terrain modifiers like rivers and forests. Rivers and forests are procedurally generated. Rivers are determined by the morphology of the height map and rainfall. Forests are determined by soil fertility.  Classification and Visual Representation of Terrain Types     For gameplay purposes and visual representation the generated map data is classified into terrain types. These types are used for gameplay (e.g. where can you construct buildings and railways, where can you grow crops?) and for the visual representation of the tiles (which tile sprite is selected for a grid location).\n Plains: Plains is either cultivated land (meadows and fields) or forests. It is the cheapest terrain to build infrastructure (roads, railroads, canals). Hills: Hills represent foothills of mountain ranges or highlands. There are cultivated and wooded hills. It is expensive to build infrastructure in hills. Mills can be built only on hill tiles with streams. Mountains: These are mountain ranges without any cultivation possible. They may be wooded if below the tree line. It is nearly prohibitively expensive to build roads and railroads there (maybe only allow this at special mountain passes). No canals can be built on mountain tiles. Sea: The sea is only navigable by sea-going ships.  Terrain Modifiers     Links     These are terrain modifiers which link two tiles/nodes. See the Transport System for details:\n Rivers: Rivers are navigable by boats. In hills mills can be built on streams. See River Generation for details. Canals: Canals enable transport of goods by boat. They can be built to create a navigable link between two tiles. Roads: Roads enable transport of goods by ox-wagon. Railways: Railways enables transport of goods by train.  Other Terrain Modifiers     They are applied on the tile/node directly:\n Forests: Forest growth is determined by temperature and soil water bands. In the first iteration of the game yearly average temperature is only determined by height from sea level (alpine tree line at 2000 m ingame). The band of soil water percentage for trees to grow ranges between 10% (permanent wilting point) and 40% (fully saturated soil). The values are simplified for gameplay purposes.  Implementation Details     The map data of tiles are stored in instances of the MapTile class. There is one MapTile instance for each grid location. The data is not fixed into discrete sets of values per tile type of the visual representation. I.e. not all tiles with a visual representation of “Mountain” have a height value of 1000 meters and an average yearly temperature of 10 C°. The map data is specific to each individual tile.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/heartland/docs/game-world/map-generation/","title":"Map Generation","parent":"Game World","content":"Detailed information about the map generation.\nRiver Generation      Rivers flow in straight lines from tile to tile. They do not flow diagonally to another tile. Generation:  For every tile find the neighboring tile with the steepest decline between both tiles. This sets the flow direction of the tile. Set a base water amount to every tile using the respective moisture values. Go through all tiles according to their hight value starting at the highest tile. For each tile set the flow amount of the flow direction to the base water amount. Add the base water amount to the base water amount of the tile targeted by the flow direction. Set river tiles to all tile with a flow amount above a set threshold value.    Farmland and Pasture Generation      The total of the farmland amount and pasture amount of a tile has a max amount of 100 (percent) Farmland is always calculated first, pasture is calculated for the remaining total Both values are influenced by moisture, temperature, and elevation (more mountainous regions have less space to do agriculture and herding) Farmland needs medium moisture and medium to high temperatures. It drops fast in high altitudes Pasture needs lower moisture than farming and is also less sensitive to lower temperatures and high altitudes  "},{"id":5,"href":"/heartland/docs/trade-system/market/","title":"Market","parent":"Trade System","content":"The markets are organised in the same way as the nation. On the national level, there is the National Market. On the provincial level, there are the Provincial Markets. One at each market town (settlement). Each population group and each industry (sources) acts as an individual trader. They are provincial traders.\nThe mechanism for trading is a kind of simulation of the behaviour at farmer’s markets. The mechanism is designed to provide a more ‘natural’ model of markets (some randomness, fixed ask prices, preference to trade locally). The disadvantages of this approach are inefficient allocations, a harder to implement mechanism, and a higher difficulty to calculate and display market prices.\nHigh-level description of the features:\n The markets are two-tiered: the national market on the higher level and provincial markets on the lower level. The ask price is fixed after the sellers have provided their offers. Buyers do not have to pay more than the ask price. Sellers only put offers on the national market, if there was no sale possible on the provincial market. Choose the bids of buyers randomly and check if a trade transaction is possible (bid unit price is equal or higher than the lowest ask unit price). The highest bid not going first is supposed to simulate some market inefficiency.  Update cycle of the trading mechanism:\n All sources (farmers, ports, mines, factories) produce output. Output is added to the total supply of the source. All sources have the trading ability and are provincial traders. All sinks calculate their demand for goods. Sinks have the trading ability as well and are provincial traders.  First: provincial level:\n Sellers (provincial traders) offer their surplus goods on their local provincial market. Buyers (provincial traders) bid on goods on their local provincial markets. Offers and bids are cleared at the provincial market. There are no transport costs for trade transactions at the provincial market (maybe added in future implementations).  Second: national level:\n If sellers still have goods left, they offer them on the national market. If buyers still demand goods, they bid on goods on the national market. Offers and bids are cleared at the national market. Buyers have to pay transport costs between the provincial markets of sellers and buyers.  Third: update of prices:\n Sellers adjust their ask prices. If they were able to sell all their surplus, the ask prices increase. Otherwise, aks prices decrease. Buyers adjust their bid price (good valuation). If they were able to fulfill their demand, they will decrease their bid prices. Otherwise, bid prices increase.
