They are able to produce surplus food to trade away to other communities (other farmers, aristocrats and workers). Farmers have to give a part of their food production as a contribution in kind to the aristocrats (serfdom). If farmers are supplied with machine parts, their food surplus rate increases. Food is also used to supply armies. For this the state builds up stockpiles of food. Iron Ore: Mined at iron ore mines and used to produce steel. Coal: Mined at coal mines and used to produce steel. Steel: Is produced in steel mills and is used to manufacture tools, weapons and is used in building infrastructure, industry, and other constructions. Machine Parts: Machine parts are consumer goods and are manufactured in machine parts factories from steel. They are sold to communities (farmers) and are exported at ports. Used by farmers, they improve the efficiency of producing food. Clothes: Clothes are consumer goods and are either produced by farmers (handcrafted clothes from wool of sheeps grazing on pastures) or manufactured in textile mills from cotton. They are sold to all communities (farmers, aristocrats, workers) and are exported at ports. Cotton: Cotton is imported at ports and is used to manufacture clothes at textile mills. Weapons: Weapons are manufactured at weapon factories from steel. They are sold to the state/military and are exported at ports. The state uses weapons to recruit divisions.  Money     Money is an abstract resource. Since the player is both owner of factories and mines and also represents the state, he gains money by selling his products to private consumers and foreign markets and by raising taxes. He uses the generated money for buying resources and paying wages and for building mines, industries and infrastructure. Representing the state, the player may use the gained wealth to invest in the military (funding the army and the navy) and use the wealth for other purposes of the state. Not only the player as representation of the state and the private sector has money, also communities have money. Section 2.3 Money Streams shows how money is gained and spend. In future iterations, the private business sector (mines and factories) may be separated from the state.

Civilization is a 4X game: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate. There is just one way to play: get as big as fast as possible and military reigns supreme (+90 % of unit types on the map are military units). Industrial Revolution does things differently:\n The game is a real-time simulation of a society during the Industrial Revolution. It is a sandbox of interconnected systems. Trade and development of your society are the core principles of the game. Because the day-to-day life in human history is and was not solely dominated by warfare. In this society the player incorporates an emerging nation state. By the foundation of factories and construction of infrastructure, he influences, encourages, and controls trade. Wealth is generated by industry and trade and feeds back into the exponentially expanding industrialization. Wealth is also used to finance a military, which protects the player’s nation against rivalling nation states. Are you able to develop your nation fast enough and gain enough strength, until the unavoidable (?) Great War lights the world on fire? The fun part of the game is influencing this system to increase the power of your state (player agency and power fantasy) and watching the different parts of the system work together (ant farm experience, the player has just an indirect impact on main parts of the system). Decisions should always be meaningful. A decision should always have drawbacks or costs (except promoting trade, should this always be a win-win situation?). The endgame is the ever rising pressure of rival nation states. In the end they have to be fought to preserve the freedom of your nation (think independence wars of Colonization). Think about a mechanic, which makes the player choose by his own will war and aggression. -\u0026gt; Military-Industrial Complex: escalating political tension leads to more tax money being used for military spending and weapons development instead of other state activities. The player has no direct control of budgeting. But by choosing escalation, he gets more money for his industries.  Who may want to play that game?      If you enjoy creating a small world If you like to immerse yourself into a fantasy world with strong connections to the time of the Industrial Revolution If you enjoy emerging gameplay and narrative  What are you doing in Industrial Revolution?      Build factories and infrastructure for a trade network to earn wealth. Use this wealth to advance technology, accelerate the industrial development and prepare your nation against your rivals. Develop your nation and build a strong defense to win the final clash of the Great War.  Other features of Industrial Revolution      The landscape/map is made out of tiles. The map is predefined and consists of a diverse landscape with streams and river valleys. At first the map represents an island nation (no land interactions with other nations). There are resources to trade and a money resource for price and cost calculations The population is dynamic.

Its geographic and geologic features (landmass, height map, rivers) and other features like vegetation, settlements, roads, and other human constructions are procedurally created.\nMap Data and Map View     The data structure of the map is separated from the visual representation of the map. The map is a two-dimensional grid and is visually represented by rectangular (four-sided) tiles. Each grid location (or tile) has additional data fields which determines the tile characteristics:\n Height map: Procedurally generated heightmap with landmasses (e.g. plains, sea, hills, mountains, … ). Height is in meters. Temperature: Average yearly temperature in degree Celsius procedurally generated by latitude and height from sea level. Maybe in future iterations temperature changes dynamically with seasons and weather. Rainfall and Moisture: Average moisture (soil water) procedurally generated by rainfall, sea and river presence. Maybe in future iterations moisture also changes dynamically with seasons and weather. Fertility: soil fertility is determined by average yearly temperature and soil water. Grain and Grazing Yield Rates: potential of tile to grow grains and grass. Depends on moisture, average temperature, and altitude. Terrain modifiers like rivers and forests. Rivers and forests are procedurally generated. Rivers are determined by the morphology of the height map and rainfall. Forests are determined by soil fertility.  Classification and Visual Representation of Terrain Types     For gameplay purposes and visual representation the generated map data is classified into terrain types. These types are used for gameplay (e.g. where can you construct buildings and railways, where can you grow crops?) and for the visual representation of the tiles (which tile sprite is selected for a grid location).\n Plains: Plains is either cultivated land (meadows and fields) or forests. It is the cheapest terrain to build infrastructure (roads, railroads, canals). Hills: Hills represent foothills of mountain ranges or highlands. There are cultivated and wooded hills. It is expensive to build infrastructure in hills. Mills can be built only on hill tiles with streams. Mountains: These are mountain ranges without any cultivation possible. They may be wooded if below the tree line. It is nearly prohibitively expensive to build roads and railroads there (maybe only allow this at special mountain passes). No canals can be built on mountain tiles. Sea: The sea is only navigable by sea-going ships.  Terrain Modifiers     Links     These are terrain modifiers which link two tiles/nodes. See the Transport System for details:\n Rivers: Rivers are navigable by boats. In hills mills can be built on streams. See River Generation for details. Canals: Canals enable transport of goods by boat. They can be built to create a navigable link between two tiles. Roads: Roads enable transport of goods by ox-wagon. Railways: Railways enables transport of goods by train.  Other Terrain Modifiers     They are applied on the tile/node directly:\n Forests: Forest growth is determined by temperature and soil water bands. In the first iteration of the game yearly average temperature is only determined by height from sea level (alpine tree line at 2000 m ingame). The band of soil water percentage for trees to grow ranges between 10% (permanent wilting point) and 40% (fully saturated soil). The values are simplified for gameplay purposes.  Implementation Details     The map data of tiles are stored in instances of the MapTile class. There is one MapTile instance for each grid location. The data is not fixed into discrete sets of values per tile type of the visual representation. I.e. not all tiles with a visual representation of “Mountain” have a height value of 1000 meters and an average yearly temperature of 10 C°. The map data is specific to each individual tile.\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/heartland/docs/game-world/map-generation/","title":"Map Generation","parent":"Game World","content":"Detailed information about the map generation.\nRiver Generation      Rivers flow in straight lines from tile to tile.

Set a base water amount to every tile using the respective moisture values. Go through all tiles according to their hight value starting at the highest tile. For each tile set the flow amount of the flow direction to the base water amount. Add the base water amount to the base water amount of the tile targeted by the flow direction. Set river tiles to all tile with a flow amount above a set threshold value.    Farmland and Pasture Generation      The total of the farmland amount and pasture amount of a tile has a max amount of 100 (percent) Farmland is always calculated first, pasture is calculated for the remaining total Both values are influenced by moisture, temperature, and elevation (more mountainous regions have less space to do agriculture and herding) Farmland needs medium moisture and medium to high temperatures.

On the national level, there is the National Market. On the provincial level, there are the Provincial Markets. One at each market town (settlement). Each population group and each industry (sources) acts as an individual trader. They are provincial traders.\nThe mechanism for trading is a kind of simulation of the behaviour at farmer’s markets. The mechanism is designed to provide a more ‘natural’ model of markets (some randomness, fixed ask prices, preference to trade locally). The disadvantages of this approach are inefficient allocations, a harder to implement mechanism, and a higher difficulty to calculate and display market prices.\nHigh-level description of the features:\n The markets are two-tiered: the national market on the higher level and provincial markets on the lower level. The ask price is fixed after the sellers have provided their offers. Buyers do not have to pay more than the ask price. Sellers only put offers on the national market, if there was no sale possible on the provincial market. Choose the bids of buyers randomly and check if a trade transaction is possible (bid unit price is equal or higher than the lowest ask unit price). The highest bid not going first is supposed to simulate some market inefficiency.  Update cycle of the trading mechanism:\n All sources (farmers, ports, mines, factories) produce output. Output is added to the total supply of the source. All sources have the trading ability and are provincial traders. All sinks calculate their demand for goods. Sinks have the trading ability as well and are provincial traders.  First: provincial level:\n Sellers (provincial traders) offer their surplus goods on their local provincial market. Buyers (provincial traders) bid on goods on their local provincial markets. Offers and bids are cleared at the provincial market. There are no transport costs for trade transactions at the provincial market (maybe added in future implementations).  Second: national level:\n If sellers still have goods left, they offer them on the national market. If buyers still demand goods, they bid on goods on the national market. Offers and bids are cleared at the national market. Buyers have to pay transport costs between the provincial markets of sellers and buyers.  Third: update of prices:\n Sellers adjust their ask prices. If they were able to sell all their surplus, the ask prices increase. Otherwise, aks prices decrease. Buyers adjust their bid price (good valuation). If they were able to fulfill their demand, they will decrease their bid prices.

Trade and Transport: the process of allocation of commodities between the production and consumption locations. Consumption: localized entities . Examples:  Populations provide labour as a production input and are the most important consumers of commodities. Industries consume commodities only to convert them into other commodities.    Production and population entities can be sources and sinks of commodities. The sources and sinks of a province are assigned to markets.

It consists of nodes and edges connecting the nodes. There is a set of edges per node. The amount of edges per node may depend on the economic activity or relative location of the node.

Node/Market: a market bundles all sources and sinks of a province. Edge: an edge connects two nodes. Goods are transported along edges between nodes. Source: all sources produce output. Output is added to the total supply at the source location. In general all sources are settlements. Their output is defined by the local inhabitants and buildings. Sink: all sinks need input.

They are provincial traders.\n  document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", function(event) { mermaid.initialize({ flowchart: { useMaxWidth: true } }); });  graph TD N[National Market] --- A[Provincial Market A] N --- B[Provincial Market B] N --- C[Provincial Market C] A --- T1[Trader] A --- T2[Trader] B --- T3[Trader] B --- T4[Trader] C --- T5[Trader] C --- T6[Trader]  The trade system has the components:    Market     Trade Manager     Trade Network     Trader     Definitions      Unit price: valuation of one unit of a good by the trader. A seller sets the ask unit price as the lowest amount of money he wants to sell a good for. A buyer sets an offer unit price as the highest amount of money he is willing to purchase a good for. Offer: contains the following pieces of information: source trader, trade good type, amount, ask unit price Bid: contains the following pieces of information: sink trader, trade good type, amount, bid unit price Transport costs: Markets know the “shortest” path to all other connected markets. This knowledge is stored in transport cost tables. Markets may update these tables regularly.  Simplifications of the trade model      All sinks and sources are located in a province (settlement). For example a coal mine is represented on the map as a tile in the vicinity of a settlement. But in the model the mine belongs to the settlement. From the viewpoint of the economic model the source and sink of the mine is located at the settlement location. The same is valid for the fields of a settlement. There are no costs and time delays in moving goods between the tiles belonging to a settlement.  Some Statistics on Trading      1000 people need 60t of food per month. 60 kg rice per person per month -\u0026gt; 2 kg rice per person per day -\u0026gt; 2,600 calories per person per day (recommended daily intake of a man: 2,500 calories, of a woman: 2,000). 1 steel mill needs 60t of iron ore and 210t coke per month to produce 60t of pig iron. A historical German blast furnace (1800) produced 2t of pig iron with 7t of coke as fuel per day (see Hochofen ).  Possible Features of Future Iterations      Demand calculation by influence maps\u0026hellip; (simulating the spread of information) Broaden the trade system, not only cities are trade nodes…  Instead of the trading mechanism described above, one could also use the double auction . Stock exchanges are examples of double auctions, therefore, this mechanism may be considered when implementing a stock exchange or commodity exchange.\nAdvantages of the double auction:\n It is a mechanical and abstract method which seems to be easy to implement. This could also be a negative point, due to not being an intuitively understandable mechanism. It is easy to calculate a market price. This makes it also easy to display the market price. It seems to provide an efficient allocation (lowest offer and highest bid go first). There is a mechanism to update ask and bid prices.  Disadvantages of the double auction:\n Trading has to be centralised. A central authority clears the market. For the player the mechanism probably does not feel like a natural model of what happens on a farmer’s market. Does not simulate frictions, fluctuations and other market inefficiencies.  Other Ideas:\n If the ask price of a produced good falls below the input prices, a producer (source) may stop production. Similarly a producer may increase the ask price (and therefore his profit margin), if he consistently trades away all his supply. There may be some special sources and sinks with other price mechanics. The player is able to choose manual price adjustment at his factories and mines. He also can choose the automated price adjustment.

When a purchase is made between two traders at different provincial markets, a cargo is spawned for the purchased goods. Transporters will use the transport network to move the cargo from the seller to the buyer.\nTransporters come in various transportation types (ox-wagon, train, ship). Switching between transportation types is done at transport hubs (trading stations, train stations, ports). A trading station may be at the same location as a train station and a port. They may be the two different nodes in the trade network. The edge between both nodes may represent the cost of unloading the train, moving the goods to the port and loading the goods on a boat.\nThe transport system has the components:\n   Cargo     Transport Hub     Transport Network     Transporter     "},{"id":30,"href":"/heartland/docs/unsorted-content/","title":"Unsorted Content","parent":"Docs","content":" Some Inspiration      “In At The Gates you might find a shrouded mineral but when you reveal it, you might just get an iron deposit that lets you build some weapons or tools, but it could be a huge gold deposit that completely changes your game.
