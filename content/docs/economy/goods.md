There are eight tradeable goods:

* **Food:** At the start of the game, the biggest part of the population consists of subsistence farmers. They are able to produce surplus food to trade away to other communities (other farmers, aristocrats and workers). Farmers have to give a part of their food production as a contribution in kind to the aristocrats (serfdom). If farmers are supplied with machine parts, their food surplus rate increases. Food is also used to supply armies. For this the state builds up stockpiles of food.
* **Iron Ore:** Mined at iron ore mines and used to produce steel.
* **Coal:** Mined at coal mines and used to produce steel.
* **Steel:** Is produced in steel mills and is used to manufacture tools, weapons and is used in building infrastructure, industry, and other constructions.
* **Machine Parts:** Machine parts are consumer goods and are manufactured in machine parts factories from steel. They are sold to communities (farmers) and are exported at ports. Used by farmers, they improve the efficiency of producing food.
* **Clothes:** Clothes are consumer goods and are either produced by farmers (handcrafted clothes from wool of sheeps grazing on pastures) or manufactured in textile mills from cotton. They are sold to all communities (farmers, aristocrats, workers) and are exported at ports.
* **Cotton:** Cotton is imported at ports and is used to manufacture clothes at textile mills.
* **Weapons:** Weapons are manufactured at weapon factories from steel. They are sold to the state/military and are exported at ports. The state uses weapons to recruit divisions.

## Money

Money is an abstract resource. Since the player is both owner of factories and mines and also represents the state, he gains money by selling his products to private consumers and foreign markets and by raising taxes. He uses the generated money for buying resources and paying wages and for building mines, industries and infrastructure. Representing the state, the player may use the gained wealth to invest in the military (funding the army and the navy) and use the wealth for other purposes of the state.
Not only the player as representation of the state and the private sector has money, also communities have money. Section 2.3 Money Streams shows how money is gained and spend.
In future iterations, the private business sector (mines and factories) may be separated from the state. In this case the private sector gains money be selling his products to private consumers, foreign markets as well as the state. The private sector may use gained wealth to influence the state.
