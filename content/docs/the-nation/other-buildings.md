* **Barracks:** Sink for weapons.
* **Stables, train stations, ports:** See [Transport Hub](docs/transport-system/transport-hub/) for details.
* **'Cosmetic' buildings:** Currently, there is no plan for implementation of farmland and pasture. They are only used to show map data.
  * Farmland: Source of food. Not a building but represented on the map as a source of goods. Farmland does not have to be directly adjacent to a settlement.
  * Pasture: Source of clothes, by farmers handcrafting clothes from the wool of the sheeps grazing on the pasture. Not a building but represented on the map as a source of goods. Pastures do not have to be directly adjacent to a settlement.
