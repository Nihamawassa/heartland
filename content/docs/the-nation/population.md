Populations are people living at a location and working in a broadly similar profession. For example a farming population is living in a settlement, working the fields surrounding their settlement. Or a population of workers living in a settlement, working in the two factories of their settlement. Populations either produce goods directly (farmers) or their labour is an input factor in mines and factories. All populations always consume food and consumer goods.

Properties of populations:

* **Size:** Total number of individuals of the population.
* **Type:** Farmer, Aristocrat, Worker, Soldier.
* **Location:** The place on the map where the population lives. All populations are located in a settlement.
* **Wealth/Goods:** Total amount of money, food, consumer goods (clothes/machine parts) owned by the population.
* **Rate of active labour force:** Not every single person of a population is part of the active labour force. Young children, house wives, the elderly may not be part of the active labour force and donâ€™t contribute to family/community income.
* **Growth function:** A population has a growth function, determining the increase (or decrease) of its size.
* **Consumption functions:** A population has functions for the consumption of its owned goods.
* **Production functions:** Some populations produce goods themselves, determined by their production functions.
* **Other functions:** a population has functions to calculate its demand of goods. The demand is determined by the use function of the population.

## Population Types

### Farmers

Farmers work the surrounding fields and pastures of a settlement. The surplus of food and clothes is made available for trade. At least at the start of the game they have to give a part of their food production as a contribution of kind to the aristocrats

### Aristocrats

Mainly consumers of food and clothes. Get a part of the food production of the settlement they are located in. The population size includes the noble family/families and their retinue.

### Workers

Workers provide their labour to surrounding factories and mines of a settlement.

### Soldiers

Man the local baracks.

## Possible Features of Future Iterations

* **Artisans:** Additional population type. They produce machine parts and clothes, using iron and cotton.
* The population acts as autonomous agents (farmers, artisans, aristocrats, miners, factory workers, soldiers, traders...)
* These agents try to maximize their wealth (maybe try different objective functions...)
