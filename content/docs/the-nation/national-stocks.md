The nation state is also an actor on the market place. The player can stockpile and use the resources wealth, food, tools, weapons and wine at the his capital city. As long as the game runs, the player has always a capital city. If his current capital gets conquered and/or destroyed, immediately another one of his cities gets promoted to capital city. If the capital was the last city, the player has lost the game. With losing the capital, the player also loses his stockpile and has to build a new one at the new capital.
