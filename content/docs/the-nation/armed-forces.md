Armed Forces are organised in divisions and fleets.

* Army: Divisions
  * Divisions of the standing forces
  * Divisions of the reserve forces
* Navy: Fleets

During the game the proportions between standing and reserve forces changes. Also the proportions between overall army size and population changes. This depends on decisions made by the state. The decisions are influenced by the amount of funds available to pay for the standing army and for stockpiling weapons for the reserve army. Additionally the political situation influences the amount of resources made available for the military.
