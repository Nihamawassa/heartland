Key features of the game world are mainly by using graphs. Four kind of network types are represented by [graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph):

* The **body of water network** - ocean, rivers, estuaries
* The [**trade network**](docs/trade-network/): a network of markets
* The [**transport networks**](docs/transport-network/): a network of transport nodes and connections from tile to tile
* The [**construction cost graphs**](docs/the-nation/infrastructure-construction-cost/): the costs to build infrastructure from tile to tile
