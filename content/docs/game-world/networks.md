Key features of the game world are mainly by using graphs. Four kind of network types are represented by [graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph):

* The network of bodies of water - ocean, rivers, estuaries
* The [trade network](docs/trade-network/): a network of markets
* The [transport networks](docs/transport-network/): a network of transport nodes and connections from tile to tile
* The construction cost graphs: the costs to build infrastructure from tile to tile
