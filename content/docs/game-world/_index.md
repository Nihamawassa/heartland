Many parts of the game world are procedurally generated. There are two main reasons for using procedural generation:

* Replayability: the target duration of a game session is 2 to 3 hours. Procedural generation is used to make each playthrough somewhat unique and therefore increase replayability
* Uniqueness: each world should feel unique to the player. This is supposed to make the world more interesting and connect the player closer to 'his' world, despite a ‘shortish’ game duration.

Procedurally generated parts of the game world:

* Game map
* Settlement names

Implementation of a world map is secondary. The game world is a fictional island in the werstern Mediteranean Sea.

## Possible Features of Future Iterations

* There are seasons and vegetation periods. Seasons influence movement and food production.
* After the vegetation period, farming produces a surplus according to the environmental prerequisites and a small chance factor...
